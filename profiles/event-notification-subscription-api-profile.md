# Event Notification Subscription Profile <!-- omit in toc -->



## Overview

The Event Notification Subscription API Specification describes the flows and payloads to allow TPPs to subscribe to events with an ASPSP.

The ASPSP API endpoints described here allow a TPP to:

* Register an event subscription with an ASPSP to subscribe to event notifications.
  * A subscription can enable real time event notifications via a HTTP callback from the ASPSP, and aggregated polling by the TPP.
* Specify a list of event types to be notified on. 
* Optionally read, update or delete a registered event subscription.

## Basics

### Overview

The steps and sequence diagram below provide a general outline of a notification flow for all resources in the R/W APIs.

#### Steps

Step 1: Setup Event Notification Subscription

* This flow begins with a TPP creating an **event-subscription** resource with an ASPSP.

Step 2: Retrieve/Update/Delete Event Notification Subscription

* The TPP may optionally read/update/delete the **event-subscription** resource.

### Subscriptions for Real Time Event Notifications and Aggregated Polling

ASPSPs may choose to offer Real Time Notifications, Aggregated Polling or a combination of both. TPPs will subscribe to the different notification mechanisms using the **event-subscription** resource.

#### Real Time Event Notifications

TPPs must register an event subscription with a CallbackUrl for TPP hosted services to receive real time event notifications from an ASPSP (providing an ASPSP supports this functionality).

The CallbackUrl **must** end with the Event Notification API specification version number, followed by â€˜/event-notifications'.

For example: 

* URL: https://tpp.com/open-banking/v3.1/event-notifications

#### Aggregated Polling

TPPs must register an event subscription to enable aggregated polling on an ASPSP (providing an ASPSP supports this functionality).

### Release Management

This section overviews the release management and versioning strategy for the Event Notification API.

#### Event-Subscription Resource

TPPs **must** register for event-subscriptions with the version of Event Notification API they have implemented. The version field of the **event-subscription** resource is used for this purpose.

##### POST

* A TPP **must only** create an **event-subscription** on one version

##### GET

* A TPP **must not** access a event-subscription on an older version, via the EventSubscriptionId for an event-subscription created in a newer version.
  * E.g., a event-subscription created in v4, accessed via v3.
* An ASPSP **must** allow an event-subscription resource to be accessed in a newer version.
* An ASPSP **must** ensure event-subscription fields are unchanged when accessed in a different version.

##### PUT

* A TPP **must not** update an event-subscription on an older version via a EventSubscriptionId created in a newer version.
  * E.g., A event-subscription is created in v4, and a PUT request on v3.
* An ASPSP **must** support updating an event-subscription from a previous version via a EventSubscriptionId created in a newer version.
  * E.g., A event-subscription is created in v3, and a PUT request on v4.

##### DELETE

* A TPP **must not** delete an event-subscription on an older version via a EventSubscriptionId created in a newer version.
  * E.g. An event-subscription is created in v4, and request DELETE on v3.
* An ASPSP **must** support deleting an event-subscription from a previous version via a EventSubscriptionId created in a newer version.
  * E.g., An event-subscription is created in v3, and request DELETE on v4.

### Event-Subscription per TPP

An ASPSP will maintain at most, a single **event-subscription** resource per TPP.

## Endpoints

A TPP will set up and maintain its event subscription details (URL, event types and version number) using the event-subscription resource.

### Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory ? |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| event-subscription |POST |POST /event-subscriptions |Optional |accounts<br>payments<br>fundsconfirmations |Client Credentials |Signed Request<br>Signed Response |No |OBEventSubscription1 |OBEventSubscriptionResponse1 |
| event-subscription |GET |GET /event-subscriptions |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |accounts<br>payments<br>fundsconfirmations |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |n/a |OBEventSubscriptionsResponse1 |
| event-subscription |PUT |PUT /event-subscriptions/{EventSubscriptionId} |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |accounts<br>payments<br>fundsconfirmations |Client Credentials |Signed Request<br>Signed Response |No |OBEventSubscriptionResponse1 |OBEventSubscriptionResponse1 |
| event-subscription |DELETE |DELETE /event-subscriptions/{EventSubscriptionId} |Mandatory (if resource POST implemented) |accounts<br>payments<br>fundsconfirmations |Client Credentials |n/a |No |n/a |n/a |


#### POST /event-subscriptions 

The API endpoint allows the TPP to ask an ASPSP to create a new **event-subscription** resource.

* The POST action allows the TPP to register an event subscription for a TPP to access event notifications.
* The ASPSP creates the **event-subscription** resource and responds with a unique EventSubscriptionId to refer to the resource.
* An ASPSP **must** respond with a 409 error if an event-subscription exists for that TPP.

#### GET /event-subscriptions

The API endpoint allows the TPP to ask an ASPSP to retrieve its **event-subscription** resource.

* The ASPSP retrieves the **event-subscription** resource and responds with the resource.

#### PUT /event-subscriptions/{EventSubscriptionId}

The API endpoint allows the TPP to ask an ASPSP to update an **event-subscription** resource.

* The PUT action allows the TPP to update an event subscription for a TPP to access event notifications.
* The ASPSP updates the **event-subscription** resource and responds with the updated resource.

#### DELETE /event-subscriptions/{EventSubscriptionId}

The API endpoint allows the TPP to ask an ASPSP to delete an **event-subscription** resource.

* The ASPSP deletes the **event-subscription** resource.
