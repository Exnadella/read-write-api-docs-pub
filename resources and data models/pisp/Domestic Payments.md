## POST /domestic-payment-consents

```POST /domestic-payment-consents```

The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new **domestic-payment-consent** resource.

* The POST action indicates to the ASPSP that a domestic payment consent has been staged. At this point, the PSU may not have been identified by the ASPSP, and the request payload may not contain any information of the account that should be debited.
* The endpoint allows the PISP to send a copy of the consent (between PSU and PISP) to the ASPSP for the PSU to authorise.
* The ASPSP creates the **domestic-payment-consent** resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.

### Status

The default Status is &quot;AwaitingAuthorisation&quot; immediately after the domestic-payment-consent has been created.

| Status |
| ------ |
| AwaitingAuthorisation |

## GET /domestic-payment-consents/{ConsentId}

```GET /domestic-payment-consents/{ConsentId}```

A PISP can optionally retrieve a payment consent resource that they have created to check its status. 

### Status

Once the PSU authorises the payment-consent resource - the Status of the payment-consent resource will be updated with &quot;Authorised&quot;.

If the PSU rejects the consent or the domestic-payment-consent has failed some other ASPSP validation, the Status will be set to &quot;Rejected&quot;.

Once a domestic-payment has been successfully created using the domestic-payment-consent, the Status of the domestic-payment-consent will be set to &quot;Consumed&quot;.

The available status codes for the domestic-payment-consent resource are:

| Status |
| ------ |
| AwaitingAuthorisation |
| Rejected |
| Authorised |
| Consumed |

## GET /domestic-payment-consents/{ConsentId}/funds-confirmation

```GET /domestic-payment-consents/{ConsentId}/funds-confirmation```

The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to confirm funds on a **domestic-payment-consent** resource.

* An ASPSP can only respond to a funds confirmation request if the **domestic-payment-consent** resource has an Authorised status. If the status is not Authorised, an ASPSP must respond with a 400 (Bad Request) and a ```UK.OBIE.Resource.InvalidConsentStatus``` error code.
* Confirmation of funds requests do not affect the status of the **domestic-payment-consent** resource.

## POST&nbsp;/domestic-payments

```POST /domestic-payments```

Once the domestic-payment-consent has been authorised by the PSU, the PISP can proceed to submitting the domestic-payment for processing:

* This is done by making a POST request to the **domestic-payments** endpoint.
* This request is an instruction to the ASPSP to begin the domestic single immediate payment journey. The domestic payment must be submitted immediately, however, there are some scenarios where the domestic payment may not be executed immediately (e.g., busy periods at the ASPSP).
* The PISP **must** ensure that the Initiation and Risk sections of the domestic-payment match the corresponding Initiation and Risk sections of the domestic-payment-consent resource. If the two do not match, the ASPSP must not process the request and **must** respond with a 400 (Bad Request).
* Any operations on the domestic-payment resource will not result in a status change for the domestic-payment resource.

### Status

A domestic-payment can only be created if its corresponding domestic-payment-consent resource has the status of "Authorised". 

The domestic-payment resource that is created successfully must have one of the following PaymentStatusCode code-set enumerations:

| Status |
| ------ |
| Pending |
| Rejected |
| AcceptedSettlementInProcess |
| AcceptedSettlementCompleted |
| AcceptedWithoutPosting |
| AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted |

## GET&nbsp;/domestic-payments/{DomesticPaymentId}

```GET /domestic-payments/{DomesticPaymentId}```

A PISP can retrieve the domestic-payment to check its status.

### Status

The domestic-payment resource must have one of the following PaymentStatusCode code-set enumerations:

| Status |
| ------ |
| Pending |
| Rejected |
| AcceptedSettlementInProcess |
| AcceptedSettlementCompleted |
| AcceptedWithoutPosting |
| AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted |

## GET&nbsp;/domestic-payments/{DomesticPaymentId}/payment-details

```GET /domestic-payments/{DomesticPaymentId}/payment-details```

A PISP can retrieve the Details of the underlying payment transaction via this endpoint. This resource allows ASPSPs to return richer list of Payment Statuses, and if available payment scheme related statuses.

### Status

The domestic-payment - payment-details must have one of the following PaymentStatusCode code-set enumerations:

| Status |
| ------ |
| Accepted |
| AcceptedCancellationRequest |
| AcceptedTechnicalValidation |
| AcceptedCustomerProfile |
| AcceptedFundsChecked |
| AcceptedWithChange |
| Pending |
| Rejected |
| AcceptedSettlementInProcess |

| Cancelled |
| NoCancellationProcess |
| PartiallyAcceptedCancellationRequest |
| PartiallyAcceptedTechnicalCorrect |
| PaymentCancelled |
| PendingCancellationRequest |
| Received |
| RejectedCancellationRequest |

## State&nbsp;Model

### Payment&nbsp;Order&nbsp;Consent

The state model for the domestic-payment-consent resource follows the generic consent state model. However, does not use the &nbsp;Revoked&nbsp; status, as the consent for a domestic-payment is not a long-lived consent.

!["Payment Order Consent Status"](images/dp/image2018-5-18_10-24-21.png "Payment Order Consent Status")

The definitions for the Status:

|  | Status |Status Description |
| ---| ------ |------------------ |
| 1 |AwaitingAuthorisation |The consent resource is awaiting PSU authorisation. |
| 2 |Rejected |The consent resource has been rejected. |
| 3 |Authorised |The consent resource has been successfully authorised. |
| 4 |Consumed |The consented action has been successfully completed. This does not reflect the status of the consented action. |

### Payment&nbsp;Order

The state model for the domestic-payment resource follows the behaviour and definitions for the ISO 20022 PaymentStatusCode code-set.

![Status](images/dp/PaymentStatusLifeCycle.png "Payment Order Status")

The definitions for the status:

|  |Status |Payment Status Description |
|--|------ |-------------------------- |
| 1 |Pending |Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending. Further checks and status update will be performed. |
| 2 |Rejected |Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected. |
| 3 |AcceptedSettlementInProcess |All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution. |
| 4 |AcceptedSettlementCompleted |Settlement on the debtor's account has been completed. |
| 5 |AcceptedWithoutPosting |Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customerâ€™s account. |
| 6 |AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted |Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed.|


#### Multiple&nbsp;Authorisation

If the payment-order requires multiple authorisations - the Status of the multiple authorisations will be updated in the MultiAuthorisation object.

![Status](images/dp/image2018-6-29_16-36-34.png "Multi Authorisation Status")

The definitions for the status:

|  |Status |Status Description |
|-- |------ |------------------ |
| 1 |AwaitingFurtherAuthorisation |The payment-order resource is awaiting further authorisation. |
| 2 |Rejected |The payment-order resource has been rejected by an authoriser. |
| 3 |Authorised |The payment-order resource has been successfully authorised by all required authorisers.|

# Data&nbsp;Model

The data dictionary section gives the detail on the payload content for the Domestic Payment API flows.

## Reused&nbsp;Classes

### OBDomestic2

This section describes the OBDomestic2 class which is reused as the Initiation object in the domestic-payment-consent and domestic-payment resources.

#### UML&nbsp;Diagram

![UML Diagram$](images/dp/OBDomestic2.gif "UML Diagram")

#### Notes

For the OBDomestic2 Initiation object:  

* All elements in the Initiation payload that are specified by the PISP must not be changed via the ASPSP as this is part of formal consent from the PSU.
* If the ASPSP is able to establish a problem with payload or any contextual error during the API call, the ASPSP must reject the domestic-payment-consent request immediately.

* If the ASPSP establishes a problem with the domestic-payment-consent after the API call, the ASPSP must set the status of the domestic-payment-consent resource to Rejected.

* DebtorAccount is **optional** as the PISP may not know the account identification details for the PSU.
* If the DebtorAccount is specified by the PISP and is invalid for the PSU, then the domestic-payment-consent will be set to Rejected after PSU authentication.
* Account Identification field usage:
  * Where "UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber" is specified as the SchemeName in the Account identification section (either DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount), the Identification field **must** be populated with the 6 digit Sort Code and 8 digit Account Number (a 14 digit field).
  * Where the "UK.OBIE.IBAN" is specified as the SchemeName in the Account identification section (either DebtorAccount or CreditorAccount), the Identification field must be populated with the full IBAN.
* The element Reference has been renamed from CreditorReferenceInformation as this is the unique ISO 20022 element used in pain.001, rather than an ISO 20022 message component.
* As a merchant may be initiating a payment via a PISP two identifiers are included in the payload: 
  * InstructionIdentification is uniquely generated by the PISP. The expectation is that this is unique indefinitely across all time periods. The PISP can ensure that this is indefinitely unique by including a date or date-time element to the field, or by inserting a unique Id. 
  * EndToEndIdentification is uniquely generated by the merchant.
* Neither the InstructionIdentification nor EndToEndIdentification will be used as the domestic-payment-consent resource identifier (ConsentId) as the ConsentId must be uniquely generated by the ASPSP.
* LocalInstrument is the requested payment scheme for execution. This is a free-text field.
* Design decisions for the Initiation section of the payload and how this maps to the ISO 20022 messaging standard are articulated in the Mapping to Schemes and Standards section.

## Person To Person Initiation via PISP

This example set of flows and payload examples are for a domestic payment initiated by a person to another person via a PISP.

In this scenario:

* The PSU has pre-specified the account from which funds will be transferred (i.e., the Debtor Account details)
* No building society accounts are involved in this interaction, and there only the sort code and account number are specified in the DebtorAccount and CreditorAccount sections.
