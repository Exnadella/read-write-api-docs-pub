and Transaction API Specification * v3.1.2</h1> <h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h2> <p>This specification describes the Account Information and Transaction API flows and payloads.
The API endpoints described here allow an Account Information Service Provider ('AISP') to:</p> <ul><li>Register an intent to retrieve account information by creating an &quot;account access consent&quot;. This registers the data &quot;permissions&quot;, expiration and historical period allowed for transactions / statements * that the customer (PSU) has consented to provide to the AISP; and</li> <li>Subsequently, retrieve account and transaction data.</li></ul> <p>This specification should be read in conjunction with Read/Write Data API Specification  which provides a description of the elements that are common across all the Read/Write Data APIs.</p> <h3 id="document-structure"><a href="#document-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> Document Structure</h3> <p>This document consists of the following parts:
<strong>Overview:</strong>  Provides an overview of the API and the key decisions and principles that contributed to the specification.
<strong>Basics:</strong>  Identifies the resources, operations that are permitted on those resources, and various special cases.
<strong>Endpoints:</strong> Provides the list of endpoints for the API specification. The individual end-points are documented in separate pages along with the data model that they employ and usage examples.
<strong>Security &amp; Access Control:</strong> Specifies the means for AISPs and PSUs to authenticate themselves and provide consent.
<strong>Data &amp; Payloads:</strong> Documents data structures and data architecture that applies to all the end-points. End-point specific data structures are documented in separate pages along with the end-points that employ the data structure.
<strong>Swagger Specifications:</strong>  Provides links to the swagger specifications for the APIs.</p> <h2 id="basics"><a href="#basics" class="header-anchor">#</a> Basics</h2> <h3 id="overview-2"><a href="#overview-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h3> <p>The figure below provides a general outline of an account information request and flow using the Account Info APIs.</p> <p><img src="images/AccountAndTransaction/accountsapiv1.gif" alt=" accountsapiv1.gif "></p> <h4 id="steps"><a href="#steps" class="header-anchor">#</a> Steps</h4> <p>Step 1: Request Account Information</p> <ul><li>This flow begins with a PSU consenting to allow an AISP to access account information data.</li></ul> <p>Step 2: Setup Account Access Consent</p> <ul><li>The AISP connects to the ASPSP that services the PSU's account(s) and creates an  <strong>account-access-consent</strong>  resource. This informs the ASPSP that one of its PSUs is granting access to account and transaction information to an AISP. The ASPSP responds with an identifier for the resource (the ConsentId - which is the intent identifier). This step is carried out by making a  <strong>POST</strong>  request to / <strong>account-access-consents</strong>  endpoint.</li> <li>The account-access-consent resource will include these fields below - which describe the data that the PSU has consented with the AISP:
<ul><li>Permissions - a list of data clusters that have been consented for access.</li> <li>Expiration Date - an optional expiration for when the AISP will no longer have access to the PSU's data.</li> <li>Transaction Validity Period - the From/To date range which specifies a historical period for transactions and statements which may be accessed by the AISP.</li></ul></li> <li>An AISP may be a broker for data to other parties, and so it is valid for a PSU to have multiple account-access-consents for the same accounts,  <strong>with different consent/authorisation parameters agreed</strong> .</li></ul> <p>Step 3: Authorise Consent</p> <ul><li>The AISP requests the PSU to authorise the consent. The ASPSP may carry this out by using a  <em>redirection flow  or a  decoupled flow</em> .
<ul><li>In a redirection flow, the AISP redirects the PSU to the ASPSP.
<ul><li>The redirect includes the ConsentId generated in the previous step.</li> <li>This allows the ASPSP to correlate the account-access-consent that was setup.</li> <li>The ASPSP authenticates the PSU.</li> <li>The ASPSP updates the state of the account-access-consent resource internally to indicate that the account access consent has been authorised.</li> <li>Once the consent has been authorised, the PSU is redirected back to the AISP.</li></ul></li> <li>In a decoupled flow, the ASPSP requests the PSU to authorise consent on an  _authentication device _ that is separate from the  <em>consumption device</em>  on which the PSU is interacting with the AISP.
<ul><li>The decoupled flow is initiated by the AISP calling a back-channel authorisation request.</li> <li>The request contains a 'hint' that identifies the PSU, paired with the consent to be authorised.</li> <li>The ASPSP authenticates the PSU and updates the state of the account-access-consent resource internally to indicate that the account access consent has been authorised.</li> <li>Once the consent has been authorised, the ASPSP can make a callback to the AISP to provide an access token.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li>The principle we have agreed is that consent is managed between the PSU and the AISP * so the account-access-consent details must not be changed (with the ASPSP) in this step. The PSU will only be able to authorise or reject the account-access-consent details in its entirety.</li> <li>During authorisation, the PSU selects accounts that are authorised for the AISP request (in the ASPSP's banking interface).</li></ul> <p>Step 4: Request Data</p> <ul><li>This is carried out by making a  <strong>GET</strong>  request the relevant  <strong>resource</strong> .</li> <li>The unique AccountId(s) that are valid for the account-access-consent will be returned with a call to GET /accounts.  <strong>This will always be the first call once an AISP has a valid access token.</strong></li></ul> <h4 id="sequence-diagram"><a href="#sequence-diagram" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sequence Diagram</h4> <p><img src="images/AccountAndTransaction/AccountsOverviewwithCIBA.png" alt=" AccountsOverviewwithCIBA.png "></p> <h4 id="account-info-high-level-flow"><a href="#account-info-high-level-flow" class="header-anchor">#</a> Account Info  High Level Flow</h4> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>participant PSU
